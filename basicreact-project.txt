To start with react projects we need to craete framework
through react building project and then through vite building project 
we'll see through react how to doit

Need to install the following packages:
create-react-app@5.1.0
Ok to proceed? (y) y

npm warn deprecated fstream-ignore@1.0.5: This package is no longer supported.

npm warn deprecated fstream@1.0.12: This package is no longer supported.
npm warn deprecated tar@2.2.2: This version of tar is no longer supported, and will not receive security updates. Please upgrade asap.
npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.
create-react-app is deprecated.

You can find a list of up-to-date React frameworks on react.dev

Success! Created 01basicreact at C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\react-projects\01basicreact
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd 01basicreact
  npm start

Happy hacking!
PS C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\react-projects>

the problem is it takes time to craete source files compared to vite
and it create node_modules file initial itself

PS C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\react-projects> cd 01basicreact
PS C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\react-projects\01basicreact> npm run start

> 01basicreact@0.1.0 start
> react-scripts start

What is the difference between NPX and NPM medium? NPM is a package 
management that is used to install, uninstall, and update Javascript packages on your workstation, 
whereas NPX is a package executer that is used to directly execute Javascript packages without installing them.
