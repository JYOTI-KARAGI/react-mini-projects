React Router is library that lets me create multiple pages (routes) in a singlw page React app.
(Note: Without React Router my  app wont feel like it has differnt pages even when the url is chnaged)

{ Want Practice Project Ideas?
Portfolio website with routes: /home, /projects, /skills, /contact

Blog with /posts, /posts/:id (learn about dynamic routing later)

If you want me to build a small project live using React Router, just say "Show me a full example", and Iâ€™ll give you a working copy-paste example.}


in React Router

<Link></Link>
it is like <a> attribute but does not reload the page when link is clicked
in place of "href" here "to" 


<NavLink></NavLink>
its like Link nut adds class when link is automatiicaly gets activ class

 <NavLink
        className={() =>
            `block py-2 pr-4 pl-3 duration-200 border-b border-gray-100 hover:bg-gray-50 lg:hover:bg-transparent lg:border-0 hover:text-orange-700 lg:p-0`
        }
    >
        Home
    </NavLink>

written inside backticks and in callback function ->
it give argument {isActive}
it checks wethere the link is active ot not means tab that tab is open or not it mat=tche the url with tab url if its matched then conditionally style the 
`${isactive?'bg-orange-700':'bg-grey-700'}`
