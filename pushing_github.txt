Great! Since you already have your GitHub profile: [https://github.com/JYOTI-KARAGI](https://github.com/JYOTI-KARAGI), here’s how you can push your **Currency Converter App** to a new GitHub repository under that profile:

---

### 🔁 STEP-BY-STEP (with your profile)

#### ✅ Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [https://github.com/JYOTI-KARAGI](https://github.com/JYOTI-KARAGI)
2. Click on **"Repositories" → "New"**
3. Fill the form:

   * **Repository name**: `currency-converter-app` (or anything else)
   * **Keep it Public**
   * **DON’T** check “Initialize with README”
4. Click **"Create repository"**

---

#### ✅ Step 2: Open Terminal in Your Local Project

```bash
cd path/to/your/project-folder
```

---

#### ✅ Step 3: Initialize Git (if not already)

```bash
git init
```

---

#### ✅ Step 4: Add Files and Commit

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

---

#### ✅ Step 5: Add Your GitHub Remote URL

Replace this with your actual repo URL (from Step 1):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/JYOTI-KARAGI/currency-converter-app.git
```

---

#### ✅ Step 6: Push to GitHub

```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

> It will ask for GitHub credentials or GitHub token (if prompted). Make sure you’re logged in.

---

#### ✅ Step 7: Confirm

Visit your repo:
👉 `https://github.com/JYOTI-KARAGI/currency-converter-app`
You should see all your files there now.

---

### ✅ Optional Final Touches

1. Add a `.gitignore` (to ignore `node_modules`):

```bash
node_modules/
dist/
.env
```

2. Add a `README.md` with your project overview (I can generate it for you).

Let me know if you want to:

* Connect it to **Vercel** or **Netlify**
* Add a nice **project description**
* Or get help with a **professional `README.md`**.
